    "prompt": "A confident freelance designer working efficiently at a modern desk in a bright, organized home studio. The scene is framed documentary-style, showing the designer in a focused flow state, surrounded by authentic creative tools like sketchbooks, color swatches, and a favorite mug. Soft, natural daylight fills the space, with subtle touches of blue in clothing or desk accessories and green from a plant. The environment feels lived-in yet professional, with layered depth—perhaps a coffee cup in the foreground, personal items in the background, and gentle diagonal lines from the desk or light. The designer’s body language is open and relaxed, with a quiet, satisfied expression that conveys calm confidence and a sense of accomplishment. Diverse representation and genuine creative details ensure the image feels both aspirational and relatable.",
